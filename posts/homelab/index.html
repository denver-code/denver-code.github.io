This server runs on my old laptop HP EliteBook G5 840 which has:<ul><li>Intel Core i7-8550U (8) @ 4.000GHz<li>Intel UHD Graphics 620<li>16GB RAM<li>SSD KXG50ZNV256G TOSHIBA</ul><p>And as it was a normal laptop that I used for work it has <code>Windows 11</code> installed on it as well as <code>Fedora Linux 38(Server Edition)</code> as a <code>dual boot</code>.<p>It all located in my room on the working desk and connected to the router via WiFi as I don't have an ethernet cable in my room.<br> <img alt="all parts" async src=overall_server_setup.jpeg width=250px><p>And it looks quite well and clean for me, but if I will upgrade architecture then I will move it to the garage(might affect on internet connection) or pantry, best thing here is cable management:<br> <img alt="cable management" async src=cable_management.jpeg width=250px><p>Desk:<br> <img alt=desk async src=desk.jpeg width=250px><h2 id=additional-hardware>Additional Hardware</h2><ul><li>External Samsung SSD 860 PRO (256GB) - which is using for small backups and running some containers that need to be fast.<li>External HDD WD My Book Duo (3TB + 3TB in Mirror Raid (1)) - which is using for storing old photos and videos as well as backups, music, and some other stuff.</ul><h2 id=software>Software</h2><p>As I mentioned before I have <code>Windows 11</code> and <code>Fedora Linux 38(Server Edition)</code> installed on my laptop, but mainly I'm using <code>Fedora Linux 38(Server Edition)</code> as my main server OS.<br> And Obviously, I'm using <code>Docker</code> and <code>Docker Compose</code> to run all the containers that I need, it includes:<ul><li><code>Yacht</code> - which is a web interface for managing docker containers.<li><code>Uptime Kuma</code> - which is a web interface for monitoring docker containers.<li><a href=https://github.com/denver-code/passport-status-bot>Passport MFA Bot</a> - which is a telegram bot that I use for tracking my passport application status.<li><code>NextCloud</code> - which is a cloud storage that I sue for accessing my files from "My Book Duo"<li>And a couple of other pet-projects.</ul><p>And at the moment all running just through <code>docker-compose</code> command right on Fedora Linux, but I'm planning to use some sort of management tool.<h2 id=cons>Cons</h2><p>Due to the fact that I'm not an expert in DevOps and System Administration stuff I have done something wrong and have some issues with my server like not being able to access it even from my local network, after few tries or few <code>ping</code> requests it starts working again, but I'm not sure what is the reason for that.<p>Other problem is scalability, while laptop has enough resources for my current needs, it has poorly managed software environment and security.<h2 id=upcoming-plans-to-improve-architecture>Upcoming Plans to Improve Architecture</h2><ol><li>I might buy a new server, it's could be either a desktop pc, rack server or microboard computer like Raspberry Pi.<li>Installing <code>Proxmox</code> to manage VM's.<li>Installing <code>Kubernetes</code> to manage containers.<li>Installing <code>Portainer</code> to manage containers. (?)<li>Installing <code>Traefik</code> to manage reverse proxy.<li>Adding local DNS server to manage .local or .home domains.<li>Adding <code>Pi-Hole</code> to manage DNS and block ads. (Possibly merge with local DNS server)<li>Adding TrueNAS/NextCloud to manage files.<li>Get new router to manage local network, as my current ISP is BT and their BT Hub is not good enough for my needs, and also as far as I know it's not possible to get a static IP from them, not sure about Business plans, but I don't want to pay more for that, considering to switch to other ISP.<li>Setup VPN server to access my local network from outside.<li>Setup <code>Grafana</code> to monitor my server. (?)</ol><p>It all will be done in next couple of weeks, so stay tuned for updates, I might create a new post for each step as well as start a youtube channel to show how to do it.<h2 id=research>Research</h2><ul><li><code>Ansible</code> - for configuration management.<li>Cheap way to get static IP and server equipment.<li>Best homelab architecture.</ul></section></article></main></div>
