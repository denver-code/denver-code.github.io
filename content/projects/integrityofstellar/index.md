- StellarNet: Our unique space network that connects different regions of the universe with advanced relays and stations, enabling seamless communication and exploration.
- StellarCity: A bustling metropolis on Mars, serving as the hub of our operations and a symbol of humanity's potential for interplanetary living.
- Game Development: We are currently developing an exciting new game where players take on the role of an important agency space operator, exploring the universe, discovering its secrets, and expanding the StellarNet network.
