Description
Noto (No Tomorrow) - this is a simple, minimalist application that will help you organize your workflow.
Here you can add tasks, change them, change their status, delete them, assign them to be completed on a particular day, or simply to a continuous list of functions, or you can make a shopping list so that you don't forget anything in the store.

What you can do now?
- add new tasks
- change their checking status
- delete tasks

What do I want to add in the future? aka ToDo
- Add tasks synchronization with the account
- Implement a daily task list
- Update the "add task" field, make it easiest and look more beautiful
- Make tasks draggable
- Implement task editing
