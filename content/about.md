I'm currenty studying Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth, UK, England.

In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, and playing. I'm also a big fan of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org). On this blog I write about projects I'm working on as well as general topics I'm interested in.
