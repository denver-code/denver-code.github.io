We're XYZ company based near your ABCD1234 property and can help with doing X thing!</em><br> Which is a spam for those people in most cases, but even 1 sucessfull contact out of 20 applications is already amazing, because you already have <code>1</code> potential client(as this client likely still waiting for application decision) that might come back to you later or even recommend your <code>XYZ</code> company to a friend.<h1 id=how>How?</h1><h2 id=tech-stack>Tech Stack</h2><ul><li><p><code>NextJS</code> as frontend framework</p><li><p><code>FastAPI</code> as a backend framework</p><li><p><code>MongoDB</code> as a main database</p><li><p><code>PostgreSQL</code> for Umami analytics</p><li><p><code>Stripe</code> for payments</p><li><p><code>Firebase/auth</code> for authorization</p><li><p>Linux-based <code>VPS</code> for hosting a backend (Includes <code>CI/CD</code>) -<code> Umami.is</code> for analytics</p><li><p><code>Vercel</code> for Front-end, Umami Instance and PostgreSQL hosting</p><li><p><code>Shadcn/ui</code> as a components library for the NextJS</p><li><p><code>Cloudflare</code> for <code>SSL</code> and protection</p><li><p><code>Docker</code> for virtualization and rapid deployments</p></ul><h1 id=real-time-deployment>Real-time deployment</h1><p>Unlikely you will be able to experience all features of the platform without subscription, so you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2iSe9blRu8">watch this video</a></p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" title="Permeso #4 | Redesign! | NextJS Firebase Fastapi Stripe  Shadcn/UI" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=300 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2iSe9blRu8 width=600></iframe><p>Slighly update version:</p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" title="Permeso #4 | Redesign! | NextJS Firebase Fastapi Stripe  Shadcn/UI" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=300 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWflNJPjxhc width=600></iframe><ul><li>Production: <a href=https://offline.permeso.ihorsavenko.com>offline.permeso.ihorsavenko.com</a></ul><h1 id=what-s-next>What's next?</h1><ul><li>A while after a fork of Permeso became a <code>Planning portal</code> that does exactly the same things but built for organisations that will be selling this data to the agencies. <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" title=" Planning Portal MVP Demo" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=300 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEdgkTXSbhI width=600></iframe><li>Also Permeso-portal are now open source, so you can check it out on <a href=https://github.com/denver-code/permeso-portal>GitHub</a><li>Stage and Production version will be merged into one (stage will be main) and will be separated from backend to demonstrate how it works and used as a demo for potential clients.</ul><h1 id=source-code>Source code</h1><p>Not publicaly available (<em>yet</em>, in case I'll decide to), but if you would like to get it or have a look at separate functions - let me know via email:<br> <code>contact@ihorsavenko.com</code> or <code>csigorek@gmail.com</code><br> Please include as much details as you can about you, your company(if applicable) and reason of interest.</section></article></main></div>
